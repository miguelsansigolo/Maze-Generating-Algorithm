# Maze-Generating-Algorithm
Recursive Maze Algorithm used to dynamically create a game map.

Program created during the second semester of my first year in college. I made this recursive algorithm that generates a maze as a personal project. Although the algorithm was not completely ready and there was still room for improvement, I decided that it was good enough for me to use in developing a small game with my peers (Asmer Bracho and Miguelantonio Guerra). I intend to revisit this algorithm in the future when I have more experience and knowledge, but at this moment I am satisfied with the results and will not focus on designing the rest of the game.

This program was developed using the Processing Library for java. You can download Processing at https://processing.org/download/ (I also included a copy of the core.jar here).
