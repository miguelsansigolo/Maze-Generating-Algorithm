# Maze-Generating-Algorithm
Recursive Maze Algorithm used to dynamically create mazes.

Program created during my second semester in college. I made this recursive algorithm that generates a maze as a personal project. Although the algorithm was not completely ready and there was still room for improvement, I decided that it was good enough for me to use in developing a small game with my peers (Asmer Bracho and Miguelantonio Guerra). I intend to revisit this algorithm in the future when I have more experience and knowledge, but at this moment I am satisfied with the results and will not focus on designing the rest of the game.

To compile my code:

This program requires the core.jar Processing Library. If you do not have this Library, please take the following steps, otherwise, skip to step 8:

1 Navigate to the website https://processing.org/ 2 In the https://processing.org/ website, find the download section on the left side of the page. 3 Click on the "No Donation" button if you do not wish to donate and then click on the "Download" button. 4 Once you are redirected to the next page, select the Operating system version you are currently using and wait for the download to start. 5 Once the download is finished, open the zip file using winrar, 7rar, winzip or any other program you prefer. 6 Extract the contents of the rar file into a new folder. 7 Once you have extracter navigate to FolderYouCreated/core/library and find the core.jar file. 8 Copy the core.jar file to the same folder that you extracted the other files (Robot.java, UseRobot.java, etc...) 9 You should now have a folder with 6 files (Robot.java, UseRobot.java, Button.java, Interface.java, README.txt and core.jar) 10 Open your "Run" window by holding down the Windows Key on your keyboard then pressing the R key. 11 Once the "Run" window is open, type cmd and press the ENTER key. 12 On the black window, please use the command cd (Change directory) to navigate to the folder where the 6 files are locates. I.E: cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\FOLDERNAME 13 Once you have navigated to the folder, insert the following command on the command prompt to compile the code: javac -cp ".;core.jar" DungeonGame.java

To run my code:

1 Once the code has been properly compiled, open your "Run" window by holding down the Windows Key on your keyboard then pressing the R key. 2 Once the "Run" window is open, type cmd and press the ENTER key. 3 On the black window, please use the command cd (Change directory) to navigate to the folder where the 6 files are locates. I.E: cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\FOLDERNAME 4 Once you have navigated to the folder, insert the following command on the command prompt to run the code: java -cp ".;core.jar" DungeonGame
